### Contributing

Please see me on ##shark on freenode if you wish to contribute. I'm there most mornings 7-9 AM EST and some afternoons.

Of course, feel free to fork & pull request, but be aware most will not be merged if we're tidying up for an update.

### Update schedule

Not here yet. Once we release 0.1 I plan to put an update schedule.
